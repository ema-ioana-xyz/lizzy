Place the weights for ManyDepth in `./KITTI_MR`.
The list of files you should have there is:
* `depth.pth`
* `encoder.pth`
* `mono_depth.pth`
* `mono_encoder.pth`
* `pose_encoder.pth`
* `pose.pth`

You can get these weights from https://github.com/nianticlabs/manydepth
We used the KITTI medium resolution weights (640 x 192 frame size).
